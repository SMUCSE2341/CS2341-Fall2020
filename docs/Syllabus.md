# CS 2341 - Data Structures

Fall 2020 - SMUFlex Version


## Overview 

Welcome to Data Structures! During this semester, we will delve into the world of object oriented C++, data organization and access, and associated software development topics.  A major aspect of computer science is finding an efficient solution to a given problem that can be implemented on a computer.  We will explore some of the more intermediate and advanced parts of the C++ language and how they can be leveraged in construction and implementing various data structures and algorithms to operate on those data structures.  We will also begin to explore how data organization and access can enhance or inhibit the efficiency of a solution to a problem.  

As a similar saying goes, programming languages are to computer science what hammers are to carpentry.  Programming is a tool that we use to communicate with a computer and express our solutions to problems. It is important to know how to use this tool efficiently to solve complex problems.  To get the most out of this class and ultimately to be successful, you must be willing to work hard.

Emphasizes the object-oriented implementation of data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, sets, and binary trees.  The course covers object-oriented software engineering strategies and approaches to programming in interdisciplinary teams.

## Textbooks

Shaffer, Cliff. *Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis, C++ version*, Edition 3.2, Dover publications.  Available in PDF at [Dr. Shaffer's Website](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/Book)

**Notes about Books** - I'm not a huge fan of textbooks.  I think they are overpriced and provide a false sense of security of the scope of a subject.  However, they are quite useful as an organized treatment of a topic.  It is important that you learn how to **figure things out** on your own.  For this reason, I typically don't follow any textbook very closely.  

HOWEVER - this is an interesting semester with the Pandemic and all.  So, I think there will be some added value in following a textbook closer than I usually would.  To some degree, the students in the class are distributed all over the world.
